Visual Hook Reference: WooCommerce
=================================

A base extension for the "Visual Hook Reference" proof-of-concept plugin, to add support for WooCommerce hooks.

In the context of this extension, we may want to add extra features that would be useful when developing with WooCommerce specifically, such as the display of the location of each of the template files being loaded (whether from WooCommerce core or from a theme).
